Wikipedia defines drop shipping as, “a supply chain management technique in which the retailer does not keep goods in stock, but instead transfers customer orders and shipment details to either the manufacturer or a wholesaler, who then ships the goods directly”.

The biggest difference between drop shipping and the standard retail model is that the selling merchant does not stock or own inventory. Instead, the seller purchases inventory as needed from a third party—usually a wholesaler or manufacturer—to fulfill orders.

Our project is a drop shipping website that is for the suppliers (buyer) who wants to provide goods for their customers and the manufacturers who want to sell their products. With this website, all the features are:
